# My name is Miller

I am a fullstack engineer who is currently in love with the ever-changing landscrap of frontend frameworks. To make this blog, I transitioned a CRA app into a Next application with some Typescript thrown in for good measure.

Things are still changing around here, but I have some plans that I will be working on in the next couple of days to get things in line.

Here's a brief "roadmap" of changes to come:

1. Finishing up styling of all pages to match a theme
1. Writing a blog post about the entire process of re-vamping my old website (including a tutorial for the homepage)
1. Developing a consistent outline for content updates and formatting

I am excited for what is to come!

All love always,

Miller
